Upgrading from supervisor 2 to supervisor 3

- In '[program:x]' sections, the keys "logfile", "logfile_backups",
  "logfile_maxbytes", "log_stderr" and "log_stdout" are no longer
  valid.  Supervisor2 logged both stderr and stdout to a single log
  file.  Supervisor 3 logs stderr and stdout to separate log files.
  You'll need to rename "logfile" to "stdout_logfile",
  "logfile_backups" to "stdout_logfile_backups", and
  "logfile_maxbytes" to "stdout_logfile_maxbytes" at the very least to
  preserve your configuration.  If you created program sections where
  "log_stderr" was true, to preserve the behavior of sending stderr
  output to the stdout log, use the "redirect_stderr" boolean in a
  program section.

- The supervisor configuration file *must* include the following
  section verbatim for the XML-RPC interface (and thus the web
  interface and supervisorctl) to work properly::

   [rpcinterface:supervisor]
   supervisor.rpcinterface_factory = supervisor.rpcinterface:make_main_rpcinterface
