Upgrading from supervisor 2 to supervisor 3

- In '[program:x]' sections, the keys "logfile", "logfile_backups",
  "logfile_maxbytes", "log_stderr" and "log_stdout" are no longer
  valid.  Supervisor2 logged both stderr and stdout to a single log
  file.  Supervisor 3 logs stderr and stdout to separate log files.
  You'll need to rename "logfile" to "stdout_logfile",
  "logfile_backups" to "stdout_logfile_backups", and
  "logfile_maxbytes" to "stdout_logfile_maxbytes" at the very least to
  preserve your configuration.  If you created program sections where
  "log_stderr" was true, to preserve the behavior of sending stderr
  output to the stdout log, use the "redirect_stderr" boolean in a
  program section.

- The supervisor configuration file *must* include the following
  section verbatim for the XML-RPC interface (and thus the web
  interface and supervisorctl) to work properly::

   [rpcinterface:supervisor]
   supervisor.rpcinterface_factory = supervisor.rpcinterface:make_main_rpcinterface

- The semantics of the 'autorestart' parameter within '[program:x]'
  sections has changed.  This parameter used to accept only 'true' or
  'false'.  It now accepts an additional value 'unexpected', which
  indicates that the process should restart from the EXITED state only
  if its exit code does not match any of those represented by the
  'exitcode' parameter in the process' configuration (IOW, a process
  crash)a.  In addition, the *default* for autorestart is now
  'unexpected' (it used to be 'true', which meant restart
  unconditionally).
