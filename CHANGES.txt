2.1b1

  - "supervisord -h" and "supervisorctl -h" did not work (traceback
    instead of showing help view (thanks to Damjan from Macedonia for
    the bug report).

  - Processes which started successfully after failing to start
    initially are no longer reported in BACKOFF state once they are
    started successfully (thanks to Damjan from Macdonia for the bug
    report).

  - Add new 'maintail' command to supervisorctl shell, which allows
    you to tail the 'main' supervisor log.  This uses a new
    readMainLog xmlrpc API.

  - Various process-state-transition related changes, all internal.
    README.txt updated with new state transition map.

  - startProcess and startAllProcesses xmlrpc APIs changed: instead of
    accepting a timeout integer, these accept a wait boolean (timeout
    is implied by process' "startsecs" configuration).  If wait is
    False, do not wait for startsecs.

  Known issues:

    Code does not match state transition map.  Processes which are
    configured as autorestarting which start "successfully" but
    subsequently die after 'startsecs' go through the transitions
    RUNNING -> BACKOFF -> STARTING instead of the correct transitions
    RUNNING -> EXITED -> STARTING.  This has no real negative effect,
    but should be fixed for correctness.

2.0

  - pidfile written in daemon mode had incorrect pid.

  - supervisorctl: tail (non -f) did not pass through proper error
    messages when supplied by the server.

  - Log signal name used to kill processes at debug level.

  - supervisorctl "tail -f" didn't work with supervisorctl sections
    configured with an absolute unix:// URL

  - New "environment" config file option allows you to add environment
    variable values to supervisord environment from config file.

2.0b1

  - fundamental rewrite based on 1.0.6, use distutils (only) for
    installation, use ConfigParser rather than ZConfig, use HTTP for
    wire protocol, web interface, less lies in supervisorctl.
