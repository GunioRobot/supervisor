- Documentation extensions:

  - [group:x] documentation

  - [eventlistener:x] documentation

  - Supervisor events documentation

  - Event listener protocol documentation

  - Capture mode / process comm events documentation

- Write "UPGRADING.txt" for people who are upgrading from supervisor
  2.0 to 3.0.

- Revisit test_startProcessGroup and test_startAllProcesses (see XXX
  comment about ordering).

- Revisit XXX comment in supervisord about removing logs at shutdown.

- Address outstanding collector issues.

- Make sure "SupervisorStateChangeEvents" are sent to listeners
  properly.

- Support groups in supervisorctl / web interface.

- Expose stderr/stdout logfiles separately in RPC interface return
  values.

- "Ordered shutdown": stop process groups in a known order, with event
  listeners typically being stopped last.  We also *might* be able to
  delay shutdown until all buffered events have been processed (or a
  timeout has been reached).

- Web interface:

   - Support POST requests.

   - Unit tests for meld classes and ui server.

   - Meta-refresh on tail page.

- Expat error on Jens' system running slapd as root after reload.

- Unit tests for log rotation.

- Command-line arg tests.

- Log logtail requests.

- Provide a way to get the supervisord pid from supervisorctl/web interface.
