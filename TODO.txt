- Implement event max_retry counter that means "after X retries of a
  rejected event, go into FATAL state".

- Generalize eventlistener request/response protocol (wrap OK/FAIL in
  RESULT envelope) so we can use it for more specialized
  communications, e.g.:

  The listener would return 'RESULT %s\n%s' (len(result), result).
  For event listeners, the "result" would be one of "OK" or "FAIL".
  For a monitor process, it would be some serialization of the monitor
  data (or maybe a failure token).

  So an event listener conversation which transitions from
  ACKNOWLEDGED to READY to BUSY back to ACKNOWLEDGED and to READY
  again might go something like this:

  -> READY\n
  <- SUPERVISOR3.0 PROCESS_COMMUNICATION_STDOUT 30 22\n
  <- process_name: foo\ngroup_name: bar\nThis is the data that was sent between the tags
  -> RESULT 2\nOK
  -> READY\n

  An equivalent monitor process conversation might look like:

  -> READY\n
  <- SUPERVISOR3.0 MONITOR_QUERY 30 20\n
  <- pids: 2601 2602 2603
  -> RESULT 10672\n<... big mess o' XML maybe ...>
  -> READY\n


- Make it possible to listen on a domain socket *and* an HTTP socket.

- General speed improvement wrangling:

  - Play around with creating a select trigger file descriptor for
    each event pool.  Maybe when an event is accepted by the pool,
    write to the file descriptor.  This will cause select to time out
    and fall through.  In an asyncore dispatcher represented by the
    file descriptor, attempt to dispatch the event.

- Fix CVS so not all checkins come from "chrism".

- FATAL state for supervisor.

   - When we try to clear the main log file and we get an IOError or an
     OSError (clearLog)

   - When we attempt to remove a process log file via os.remove (or
     equivalent all into handlers) and we get an IOError or an OSError
     (clearProcessLog)

   - When we try to kill a process and the os.kill command raises an
     exception (stopProcess)

- Support stopping and starting groups in web interface.

- Support operations against both stderr and stdout logs within web
  interface.

- Revisit test_startProcessGroup and test_startAllProcesses (see XXX
  comment about ordering).

- Address outstanding collector issues.

- We *might* be able to delay shutdown until all buffered events have
  been processed (or a timeout has been reached).

- Web interface:

   - Support POST requests.

   - Unit tests for meld classes and ui server.

   - Meta-refresh on tail page.

- Expat error on Jens' system running slapd as root after reload.

- Unit tests for log rotation.

- Command-line arg tests.

- Log logtail requests.

- Provide a way to get the supervisord pid from supervisorctl/web interface.
