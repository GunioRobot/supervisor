- Web interface:

   - present status in addition to state (e.g. spawnerr, etc, same as
     supervisorctl)

   - Use HTTP_HOST for generated URL names in web.py, use POST requests
     and deferreds.

- Rewrite RPC stuff: use ProcessStates rather than direct attribute
  access, rename methods.

- Unit tests for meld classes and ui server.

- Unit tests for log rotation.

- Better remote explanation when kill_undead needs to happen from
  supervisorctl (long blockage).

- Command-line arg tests.

- Log logtail requests.

- Stop logging all RPC requests in info mode when we ship

- Test on Linux.
