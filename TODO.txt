- Documentation extensions:

  - [group:x] documentation

  - [eventlistener:x] documentation

  - Capture mode / process comm events documentation

- Consider changing event type names to be prefixed with their
  "parent" type so listeners can make a determination by doing a
  "startswith" instead of knowing how the event hierarchy is
  structured.

- Write "UPGRADING.txt" for people who are upgrading from supervisor
  2.0 to 3.0.

- Revisit test_startProcessGroup and test_startAllProcesses (see XXX
  comment about ordering).

- Allow process config to opt out of capture mode.

- Revisit XXX comment in supervisord about removing logs at shutdown.

- Address outstanding collector issues.

- Make sure "SupervisorStateChangeEvents" are sent to listeners
  properly.

- Support groups in supervisorctl / web interface.

- Expose stderr/stdout logfiles separately in RPC interface return
  values.

- "Ordered shutdown": stop process groups in a known order, with event
  listeners typically being stopped last.  We also *might* be able to
  delay shutdown until all buffered events have been processed (or a
  timeout has been reached).

- Release a meld3 version that doesn't require that ext_modules get
  built if an environment variable is present (or if distutils
  supports conditionally compiling extensions, use whatever it does).
  Make supervisor's setup.py depend on this version and document how
  to cause supervisor's "setup.py install" to install a C-free meld3.

- Web interface:

   - Support POST requests.

   - Unit tests for meld classes and ui server.

   - Meta-refresh on tail page.

- Expat error on Jens' system running slapd as root after reload.

- Unit tests for log rotation.

- Command-line arg tests.

- Log logtail requests.

- Provide a way to get the supervisord pid from supervisorctl/web interface.
