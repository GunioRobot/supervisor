 - Collector issue 152:

   I'd like supervisor to look after a number of postgres instances
   (well, initially only 1, but I will need it to manage 3). The first
   difficulty I had was that the postgres start-up program (pg_ctl)
   takes an options param that it passes directly to the postmaster
   program it controls, which can contain several options that only
   the postmaster understands and it expects these to be in quotes so
   they are treated as a group, e.g pg_ctl -o "-p 4321 -h hostname -d
   datadir" but supervisor doesn't appear to preserve the quotes. In
   my case I only need the one option so I used -o "-p4321", as a
   workaround.
