- General speed improvement wrangling:

  - Play around with creating a select trigger file descriptor for
    each event pool.  When an event is accepted by the pool, write to
    the file descriptor.  This will cause select to time out and fall
    through.  In an asyncore dispatcher represented by the file
    descriptor, attempt to dispatch the event.

- Add a new cwd option that will chdir after the fork-exec.

- Move set of 'SUPERVISOR_ENABLED' envvar to process spawn method.

- Fix CVS so not all checkins come from "chrism".

- FATAL state for supervisor.

   - When we try to clear the main log file and we get an IOError or an
     OSError (clearLog)

   - When we attempt to remove a process log file via os.remove (or
     equivalent all into handlers) and we get an IOError or an OSError
     (clearProcessLog)

   - When we try to kill a process and the os.kill command raises an
     exception (stopProcess)

- Support stopping and starting groups in supervisorctl / web
  interface.

- Support operations against both stderr and stdout logs within
  supervisorctl / web interface. 

- Revisit test_startProcessGroup and test_startAllProcesses (see XXX
  comment about ordering).

- Address outstanding collector issues.

- We *might* be able to delay shutdown until all buffered events have
  been processed (or a timeout has been reached).

- Web interface:

   - Support POST requests.

   - Unit tests for meld classes and ui server.

   - Meta-refresh on tail page.

- Expat error on Jens' system running slapd as root after reload.

- Unit tests for log rotation.

- Command-line arg tests.

- Log logtail requests.

- Provide a way to get the supervisord pid from supervisorctl/web interface.
