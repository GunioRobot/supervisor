- Reconsider what state transition needs to happen when a process
  exits from the RUNNING state with an unexpected exit code.
  Currently, it really doesn't matter whether the process exits with
  an expected or unexpected error code; if it's set to autorestart, it
  starts again unconditionally.  But to accomodate
  restart-only-on-crash, the 'autostart' value may need to be made
  into a trinary.  In this design, when autorestart=true, supervisor
  will autorestart the process regardless of the exit code.  When
  autorestart=unexpected, supervisor will only restart the process if
  it exits with an unexpected exit code.  This may imply changing the
  process state map slightly, which may add an event notification
  type.

- Fix CVS so not all checkins come from "chrism".

- FATAL state for supervisor.

- Figure out how to make sample.conf evident when supervisor is installed
  via easy_install.

- Support stopping and starting groups in supervisorctl / web
  interface.

- Support operations against both stderr and stdout logs within
  supervisorctl / web interface. 

- Revisit test_startProcessGroup and test_startAllProcesses (see XXX
  comment about ordering).

- Address outstanding collector issues.

- We *might* be able to delay shutdown until all buffered events have
  been processed (or a timeout has been reached).

- Release a meld3 version that doesn't require that ext_modules get
  built if an environment variable is present (or if distutils
  supports conditionally compiling extensions, use whatever it does).
  Make supervisor's setup.py depend on this version and document how
  to cause supervisor's "setup.py install" to install a C-free meld3.

- Web interface:

   - Support POST requests.

   - Unit tests for meld classes and ui server.

   - Meta-refresh on tail page.

- Expat error on Jens' system running slapd as root after reload.

- Unit tests for log rotation.

- Command-line arg tests.

- Log logtail requests.

- Provide a way to get the supervisord pid from supervisorctl/web interface.

- Add a new cwd option that will chdir after the fork-exec.
